    <!-- Theory Screen Intro Texts -->
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_1">Let\'s start with four basic letters of the Koine Greek alphabet. Take time to learn the shapes, sounds, and both uppercase and lowercase forms.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_2">Great progress! Now let\'s continue with four more letters, vowels and consonants, very frequently used in Koine.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_3">You\'re advancing well! This batch introduces four more consonants that appear frequently in Koine texts.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_4">Let\'s learn four more letters. Notice sigma has different forms depending on its position in a word.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_5">These four letters include important vowels that will help you read many more Koine words.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_letters_batch_6">Congratulations on reaching the final letters! These complete your knowledge of the Koine alphabet.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_diphthongs_batch_1">Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels that form a single sound. These I-diphthongs combine various vowels with iota.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_diphthongs_batch_2">These U-diphthongs combine vowels with upsilon to create distinct sounds.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_improper_diphthongs">Improper diphthongs use an iota subscript beneath a vowel. They\'re pronounced as a single vowel sound, with the iota being silent.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_breathing_marks">Breathing marks appear on vowels at the beginning of words and indicate whether to add an \'h\' sound. Every Koine word that begins with a vowel must have a breathing mark.</string>
    <string name="theory_intro_accent_marks">There are three kinds of accents in Koine: acute (´), grave (`), and circumflex (῀). Accents are placed above a vowel and help with word pronunciation.</string>
